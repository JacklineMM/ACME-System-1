# ACME-System-1
An automation that prompts the user to input their login credentials, logs into the ACME web page, downloads a file on the legacy system

# BY
Jackline Makena

# DESCRIPTION
This is a uipath studio automation whereby the bot  checks whether there are credentials saved on the Windows credentials manager.
If they are not set; the bot prompts the user to input their email and password. If the user doesn't provide their credentials, the bot
terminates the workflow. If the user provides credentials, the bot opens the ACME system webpage on Chrome; types in the email and password then logs into the page.
The bot navigates to the user options and clicks on the download client and support button. It then downloads the file under legacy system and logs out

# SET UP AND OPERATION
All you need is a PC with Uipath Studio, Google Chrome installed and network connectivity
